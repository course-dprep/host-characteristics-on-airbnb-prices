The gin production was the source of much of the wealth that built the city into what it is today.<br />Schiedam was first made into a village in the year 1230 when the local river, The Schie, had a dam built on it to protect it from the sea. The dam brought much trade to the area, due to goods being brought to, or transported from the area, to  towns such as Leiden, Delft and Haarlem. The village quickly grew and in the year 1275 received a charter to become a city from the sister of William The 2nd.

I fell in love with Bosa while making my final thesis project at the university: the design proposal was a minimal intervention to re-qualify the Temo river's banks in the old town. Few years later, I managed to acquire this old house right in the medieval city center, where I try to be every time I free myself from work.
Due to my work, I travel quite a bit, and lately I find myself eager to learn much more about different traditions and costumes (especially from Asia and the Far East... China, India and Vietnam, and more recently from Central America and the Caribbeans). I find it impressive how many things we can learn from each other cultures, and how much can be adapted and adjusted among different locations. I like this positive side of globalization, where intelligence becomes global and local traditions acquire value.
I am currently committed in a research aiming to drastically lower the construction cost (price per square meter) of social housing through implementation of sustainable practices: everybody should have the right to a comfortable home, in a cleaner world.
I am based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, but I often engage in projects which bring me in beautiful places: I am currently living in Phoenix, Arizona.

Thanks for looking into my profile! :)
I am a 31 year old Dutch guy, living in the heart of Rotterdam. As I'm writing this (February 2017), I have used Airbnb only for my own travels. In March that will change. I will visit Peru for a month and I'd be happy to let my apartment be of use for you! I am quite thrilled about this trip, as I've never been to South America before and heard great stories about it.

When I am not travelling, I work as a coach for people who depend on a social benefit for their income and have a very long distance to the labour market. I try to help them to work on their problems by coaching them and by connecting them to the right professionals, projects and organizations.

Als ik thuis ben en mijn koffie drink kijk ik graag naar de vrachtschepen die voorbij varen. Dit geeft mij het gevoel in een havenstad te wonen.
Ik maak graag wandelingen door de stad en drink mijn biertje in toeristisch Delfshaven wat 5 min lopen van mijn huis ligt. 
Hier ligt veel geschiedenis van de stad. Vanuit deze plek is Rotterdam min of meer uitgebouwd. Het is daar rustig en mooi. Het lijkt een beetje op Amsterdam met zijn grachten en pakhuiswoningen.

Ik ben een creatief persoon en ben graag fysiek bezig.
In mijn B&B zul je de sfeer van creativiteit kunnen proeven.
De inrichting van heel mijn huis heb ik in de stijl van het huis wat in 1924 gebouwd is. Bovendien is het een bewuste keuze om te recycelen.

Naast mijn benb vind ik het heerlijk om in mijn tuin te tuinieren.  Ik schilder graag en maak tassen. 
Ik help anderen hun huis te reorganiseren en opknappen.

Wij een ondernemers familie uit de omgeving van Rotterdam en in 2003 is Kick ons team komen versterken.

Als er een kind in je gezin komt wordt alles anders, vooral het op vakantie gaan. Je moet ineens rekening met alles houden, niet te warm, niet te koud, kinderbadje, tussen de middag slapen, kinderbedje, geen stijl in zee lopend strand, geen rotsen, geen hoge golven... en als de kinderen ouder worden; vermaken zij zich wel? Is er genoeg te doen? Zijn er wel vriendjes? Is er wel eten wat ze lusten?

Wij hebben de eerste jaren daar wel mee geworsteld, want je wilt het zelf ook naar je zin hebben op vakantie... je moet immers je het hele jaar al wegcijferen.

Onze vakantie ervaringen:

We zijn naar een resort in Turkije geweest...
Wij vonden het veel te massaal, heel de dag door buffetten en te ver buiten het stadje. Alle resorts staan in de middle of nowhere zodat je alles binnen het complex moet doen. En niet te vergeten het onvermijdelijke animatie-team die iedere avond een toneelstukje opvoert.

We zijn naar het ""kindvriendelijke"" Menorca geweest...
Het begon met een overstap op Ibiza (vliegtuig vol Ibiza-gangers die zich doodergeren aan de kinderen), geen strand (moerassig), onverwarmd zwembad (steenkoud) en saai... Het is niet kindvriendelijk..., er zijn alleen heel veel kinderen!

We zijn naar Tenerife (en alle andere Canarische eilanden) geweest...
Na onze ervaringen in Turkije en Menorca wilden we graag een hotel aan een boulevard zodat we 's avonds nog wat konden lopen en wat drinken...het hotel was schitterend, maar zodra je de boulevard op kwam... wat een armoe! Straten kapot, veel leegstand in de winkelruimtes, overal schreeuwende aanbiedingen voor een pint bier voor € 1,-

We zijn naar Club Med geweest (Tunesie en Turkije)...
Slechte accomodaties, wel goed publiek maar het concept dat het personeel  iedere keer bij je aan tafel komt zitten sprak ons niet zo aan.

Toen dachten we, als we nu eens een eigen huis huren met een zwembad in Spanje..., maar waar? Na wat ge (Hidden by Airbnb) kwamen we uit bij Moraira! Dit sprak ons meteen aan... authentiek, geen hoogbouw, niet te toeristisch, vissersplaatsje, jachthaven, veel winkeltjes, restaurantjes en terrassen, zandstrand, in een baai, strand loopt niet stijl in zee, altijd zon (320 dagen van het jaar), nagenoeg geen regen, goede temperatuur, genoeg vermaak in de buurt voor jong en oud, tennisbanen (ons zoontje tennist veel en graag), kortom dit moest het zijn!

Al deze informatie vonden we op de site van Xenofilia, twee Nederlandse broers die vakantiehuizen verhuren en er zelf ook wonen. Een groot huis, Xenofilia I... 4 kamers, 4 badkamers, verwarmd zwembad en een eigen tennisbaan... Dit is het!

Alle opa's en oma's mee en met z'n zevenen naar Spanje. We hebben een geweldige vakantie gehad, en van het plaatsje Moraira was niets gelogen, helmaal naar ons zin! Alles is er luxe afgewerkt, de straten, het meubilair, schitterende rotondes met kunstwerken. Wij hebben echt wel veel gezien, maar dit was fantastisch! Je zou dan aan st. Tropez prijzen gaan denken...niets is minder waar, een wijntje op het strand kost € 2,- en het eten in de restaurantjes en op de terrassen is zeker niet duurder dan in Nederland.

Inmiddels zijn we zo'n 15 keer terug geweest, nog een paar keer in Xenofilia I zonder opa's en oma's maar met een vriendje voor Kick.

Het enige nadeel van een huis is dat je alles met de auto moet doen... boodschappen, naar het strand en de kinderen zitten een beetje opgesloten in en om het huis. Dus, hebben we de laatste paar keren een appartement in het centrum gehuurd. Zo kon onze zoon, inmiddels 11, gewoon zelf naar het strand en weer terug naar het appartement. Ook hoefden we nu geen vriendje meer mee te nemen, er zijn genoeg kinderen op het strand, en daar is altijd zat te doen... Voetballen, volleyballen, vissen, krabbetjes zoeken, snorkelen, tegen de branding in springen en natuurlijk zwemmen. Wij vinden het lekker om als we van het strand komen op het balkon lekker een wijntje te drinken en wat tappaatjes te eten. Daar vind Kick natuurlijk geen bal aan en hij vindt tappas niet lekker. Hij gaat dan een pizza voor zichzelf halen bij de pizzaria 100 meter verder en gaat lekker even op zijn iPad een spelletje spelen. Iedereen blij! 

Wij zijn ook een keer in januari gegaan, en in de voorjaarsvakantie... hoe zou het dan zijn? Nou, ook gewoon 20 graden en zonnig en totaal niet uitgestorven!

Moeten we dan niet kijken of we hier wat kunnen kopen? Maar we hebben zelf geen tijd om vaak te gaan... kunnen we het dan niet verhuren als we zelf niet gaan?

De rest is geschiedenis... dus kom genieten van dit pareltje aan de Costa Blanca en geniet van ons luxe appartement. 

Welkom!

I live there with a lot of pleasure! The location is fantastic, I have very nice neighbors and the apartment itself has everything I could want. But the terraces are my pride and joy, and also the main reason for buying the apartment. I have what you call in Dutch ""green fingers.""

Ik ben geen veeleisende bewoner en zal goed met uw spullen omgaan. 

Mijn stijl van reizen is low budget, ik maak graag gebruik van hostels en dergelijke, kamperen is echter niet mijn stijl. Ik kom graag in contact met plaatselijke bewoners om te horen hoe zij hun leven ervaren en hun mening te horen over deze wereld.

In het verleden heb ik op diverse reizen naar Zuid-Afrika ook vrijwilligerswerk gedaan (samen met één van mijn dochters) in de townships van Port Elizabeth. Ik vind het belangrijk om te proberen mijn steentje bij te dragen in de leefbaarheid voor andere mensen op onze aarde

I'm not a demanding occupant and will properly handle your belongings.

My style of travel is low budget , I like to use hostels and such , camping is not my style. I like to come in contact with local residents to hear how they experience their lives and hear their views on the world.

In the past I have also volunteered on several trips to South Africa (along with one of my daughters) in the townships of Port Elizabeth. I think it's important to try to do my part in the quality of life for other people on earth

Welcome to my page. My name is Jolie. I'm a clinical psychologist who moved to Rotterdam 5 years ago. I'm the first owner of my loft and have designed the interior myself with great care. I enjoy living here very much. After some nice experiences with Airbnb as a guest, I decided it would be selfish to keep my spare bedroom all to myself, especially since it has such a great view of the Rotterdam skyline. I live with my dachshund Laika, but she doesn't talk back very much. That's another reason why I've decided to make my guest bedroom available on Airbnb. In the evening I am mostly home and always open to a nice conversation, or to just hang out. But please don't feel obliged, as I know very well how nice it can be to retreat in a nice private room when travelling.

I'm Julian and hopefully I will be your next host! 

About me, my idea of a good time is going on adventures around the world with friends or alone to meet new ones. I’m passionate about history, theology, literature and people. At the moment I’m working as a part-time marketeer while I'm studying for a master’s degree in history. Since studying is expensive, (could be worse, looking at you Amerika) I’m renting out my apartment from time to time to make ends meet.

Wij een ondernemers familie uit de omgeving van Rotterdam en in 2003 is Kick ons team komen versterken.

Als er een kind in je gezin komt wordt alles anders, vooral het op vakantie gaan. Je moet ineens rekening met alles houden, niet te warm, niet te koud, kinderbadje, tussen de middag slapen, kinderbedje, geen stijl in zee lopend strand, geen rotsen, geen hoge golven... en als de kinderen ouder worden; vermaken zij zich wel? Is er genoeg te doen? Zijn er wel vriendjes? Is er wel eten wat ze lusten?

Wij hebben de eerste jaren daar wel mee geworsteld, want je wilt het zelf ook naar je zin hebben op vakantie... je moet immers je het hele jaar al wegcijferen.

Onze vakantie ervaringen:

We zijn naar een resort in Turkije geweest...
Wij vonden het veel te massaal, heel de dag door buffetten en te ver buiten het stadje. Alle resorts staan in de middle of nowhere zodat je alles binnen het complex moet doen. En niet te vergeten het onvermijdelijke animatie-team die iedere avond een toneelstukje opvoert.

We zijn naar het ""kindvriendelijke"" Menorca geweest...
Het begon met een overstap op Ibiza (vliegtuig vol Ibiza-gangers die zich doodergeren aan de kinderen), geen strand (moerassig), onverwarmd zwembad (steenkoud) en saai... Het is niet kindvriendelijk..., er zijn alleen heel veel kinderen!

We zijn naar Tenerife (en alle andere Canarische eilanden) geweest...
Na onze ervaringen in Turkije en Menorca wilden we graag een hotel aan een boulevard zodat we 's avonds nog wat konden lopen en wat drinken...het hotel was schitterend, maar zodra je de boulevard op kwam... wat een armoe! Straten kapot, veel leegstand in de winkelruimtes, overal schreeuwende aanbiedingen voor een pint bier voor € 1,-

We zijn naar Club Med geweest (Tunesie en Turkije)...
Slechte accomodaties, wel goed publiek maar het concept dat het personeel  iedere keer bij je aan tafel komt zitten sprak ons niet zo aan.

Toen dachten we, als we nu eens een eigen huis huren met een zwembad in Spanje..., maar waar? Na wat ge (Hidden by Airbnb) kwamen we uit bij Moraira! Dit sprak ons meteen aan... authentiek, geen hoogbouw, niet te toeristisch, vissersplaatsje, jachthaven, veel winkeltjes, restaurantjes en terrassen, zandstrand, in een baai, strand loopt niet stijl in zee, altijd zon (320 dagen van het jaar), nagenoeg geen regen, goede temperatuur, genoeg vermaak in de buurt voor jong en oud, tennisbanen (ons zoontje tennist veel en graag), kortom dit moest het zijn!

Al deze informatie vonden we op de site van Xenofilia, twee Nederlandse broers die vakantiehuizen verhuren en er zelf ook wonen. Een groot huis, Xenofilia I... 4 kamers, 4 badkamers, verwarmd zwembad en een eigen tennisbaan... Dit is het!

Alle opa's en oma's mee en met z'n zevenen naar Spanje. We hebben een geweldige vakantie gehad, en van het plaatsje Moraira was niets gelogen, helmaal naar ons zin! Alles is er luxe afgewerkt, de straten, het meubilair, schitterende rotondes met kunstwerken. Wij hebben echt wel veel gezien, maar dit was fantastisch! Je zou dan aan st. Tropez prijzen gaan denken...niets is minder waar, een wijntje op het strand kost € 2,- en het eten in de restaurantjes en op de terrassen is zeker niet duurder dan in Nederland.

Inmiddels zijn we zo'n 15 keer terug geweest, nog een paar keer in Xenofilia I zonder opa's en oma's maar met een vriendje voor Kick.

Het enige nadeel van een huis is dat je alles met de auto moet doen... boodschappen, naar het strand en de kinderen zitten een beetje opgesloten in en om het huis. Dus, hebben we de laatste paar keren een appartement in het centrum gehuurd. Zo kon onze zoon, inmiddels 11, gewoon zelf naar het strand en weer terug naar het appartement. Ook hoefden we nu geen vriendje meer mee te nemen, er zijn genoeg kinderen op het strand, en daar is altijd zat te doen... Voetballen, volleyballen, vissen, krabbetjes zoeken, snorkelen, tegen de branding in springen en natuurlijk zwemmen. Wij vinden het lekker om als we van het strand komen op het balkon lekker een wijntje te drinken en wat tappaatjes te eten. Daar vind Kick natuurlijk geen bal aan en hij vindt tappas niet lekker. Hij gaat dan een pizza voor zichzelf halen bij de pizzaria 100 meter verder en gaat lekker even op zijn iPad een spelletje spelen. Iedereen blij! 

Wij zijn ook een keer in januari gegaan, en in de voorjaarsvakantie... hoe zou het dan zijn? Nou, ook gewoon 20 graden en zonnig en totaal niet uitgestorven!

Moeten we dan niet kijken of we hier wat kunnen kopen? Maar we hebben zelf geen tijd om vaak te gaan... kunnen we het dan niet verhuren als we zelf niet gaan?

De rest is geschiedenis... dus kom genieten van dit pareltje aan de Costa Blanca en geniet van ons luxe appartement. 

Welkom!

Welcome at my page!:)
My name is Mirjam, I'm a Dutchie, in daily life I'm a social worker. In my spare time I love to visit new places, nature, singing, a sucker for good coffee,  going out for walks,  try to play guitar ( with the emphasis on 'try'), do my best to give some love to my plants, like to cook and ofcourse... traveling!

Since I was young I already liked traveling.  I remember my family and I were traveling by campervan. Such a joy we had. I continued traveling when I got older. I've been to countries within Europe, but also outside Europe, like: the US, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, Curacaõ, Laoh and Thailand.  I've stayed more than a year in Thailand where I've worked on voluntary base as a counselor. 

When I travel I would like to have that feeling of 'home'. That's why I  love to host and to give my guests that feeling of 'home' as well. 

That feeling of traveling and meeting new people, makes me come alive. 
So why not meeting new people, travelers, in my city Rotterdam?
